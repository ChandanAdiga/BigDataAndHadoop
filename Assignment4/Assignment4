Assignment 01:
	1. For the given input file (Module_4_Ex1.txt), find the maximum scorer in each gender and three
	age categories: less than 20, 20 to 50, greater than 50.
	Hint: You would like to use a custom partitioner for it
	
	2. For the given input file (Module_4_Ex2.txt) find out the number of records, where second field
	is either less than 10 or more than 50 without writing the output to HDFS.
	Hint: You might like to just profile the data with counter

	3. Given you have a stores location file (store_locations.txt) and a stores sales file
	(store_sales.txt)
	The store locations file has two fields (store location, store name) and store sales file has two
